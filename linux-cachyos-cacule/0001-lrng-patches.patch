Subject: [PATCH 01/14] Linux Random Number Generator
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In an effort to provide a flexible implementation for a random number
generator that also delivers entropy during early boot time, allows
replacement of the deterministic random number generation mechanism,
implement the various components in separate code for easier
maintenance, and provide compliance to SP800-90[A|B|C], introduce
the Linux Random Number Generator (LRNG) framework.

The general design is as follows. Additional implementation details
are given in [1]. The LRNG consists of the following components:

1. The LRNG implements a DRNG. The DRNG always generates the
requested amount of output. When using the SP800-90A terminology
it operates without prediction resistance. The secondary DRNG
maintains a counter of how many bytes were generated since last
re-seed and a timer of the elapsed time since last re-seed. If either
the counter or the timer reaches a threshold, the secondary DRNG is
seeded from the entropy pool.

In case the Linux kernel detects a NUMA system, one secondary DRNG
instance per NUMA node is maintained.

2. The DRNG is seeded by concatenating the data from the
following sources:

(a) the output of the entropy pool,

(b) the Jitter RNG if available and enabled, and

(c) the CPU-based noise source such as Intel RDRAND if available and
enabled.

The entropy estimate of the data of all noise sources are added to
form the entropy estimate of the data used to seed the DRNG with.
The LRNG ensures, however, that the DRNG after seeding is at
maximum the security strength of the DRNG.

The LRNG is designed such that none of these noise sources can dominate
the other noise sources to provide seed data to the DRNG during due to
the following:

(a) During boot time, the amount of received interrupts are the trigger
points to (re)seed the DRNG.

(b) At runtime, the available entropy from the slow noise source is
concatenated with a pre-defined amount of data from the fast noise
sources. In addition, each DRNG reseed operation triggers external
noise source providers to deliver one block of data.

3. The entropy pool accumulates entropy obtained from certain events,
which will henceforth be collectively called "slow noise sources".
The entropy pool collects noise data from slow noise sources. Any data
received by the LRNG from the slow noise sources is inserted into a
per-CPU entropy pool using a hash operation that can be changed during
runtime. Per default, SHA-256 is used.

 (a) When an interrupt occurs, the high-resolution time stamp is mixed
into the per-CPU entropy pool. This time stamp is credited with
heuristically implied entropy.

 (b) HID event data like the key stroke or the mouse coordinates are
mixed into the per-CPU entropy pool. This data is not credited with
entropy by the LRNG.

 (c) Device drivers may provide data that is mixed into an auxiliary
pool using the same hash that is used to process the per-CPU entropy
pool. This data is not credited with entropy by the LRNG.

Any data provided from user space by either writing to /dev/random,
/dev/urandom or the IOCTL of RNDADDENTROPY on both device files
are always injected into the auxiliary pool.

In addition, when a hardware random number generator covered by the
Linux kernel HW generator framework wants to deliver random numbers,
it is injected into the auxiliary pool as well. HW generator noise source
is handled separately from the other noise source due to the fact that
the HW generator framework may decide by itself when to deliver data
whereas the other noise sources always requested for data driven by the
LRNG operation. Similarly any user space provided data is inserted into
the entropy pool.

When seed data for the DRNG is to be generated, all per-CPU
entropy pools and the auxiliary pool are hashed. The message digest
forms the new auxiliary pool state. At the same time, this data
is used for seeding the DRNG.

To speed up the interrupt handling code of the LRNG, the time stamp
collected for an interrupt event is truncated to the 8 least
significant bits. 64 truncated time stamps are concatenated and then
jointly inserted into the per-CPU entropy pool. During boot time,
until the fully seeded stage is reached, each time stamp with its
32 least significant bits is are concatenated. When 16 such events
are received, they are injected into the per-CPU entropy pool.

The LRNG allows the DRNG mechanism to be changed at runtime. Per default,
a ChaCha20-based DRNG is used. The ChaCha20-DRNG implemented for the
LRNG is also provided as a stand-alone user space deterministic random
number generator. The LRNG also offers an SP800-90A DRBG based on the
Linux kernel crypto API DRBG implementation.

The processing of entropic data from the noise source before injecting
them into the DRNG is performed with the following mathematical
operations:

1. Truncation: The received time stamps are truncated to 8 least
significant bits (or 32 least significant bits during boot time)

2. Concatenation: The received and truncated time stamps as well as
auxiliary 32 bit words are concatenated to fill the per-CPU data
array that is capable of holding 64 8-bit words.

3. Hashing: A set of concatenated time stamp data received from the
interrupts are hashed together with the current existing per-CPU
entropy pool state. The resulting message digest is the new per-CPU
entropy pool state.

4. Hashing: When new data is added to the auxiliary pool, the data
is hashed together with the auxiliary pool to form a new auxiliary
pool state.

5. Hashing: A message digest of all per-CPU entropy pools and the
auxiliary pool is calculated which forms the new auxiliary pool
state. At the same time, this message digest is used to fill the
slow noise source output buffer discussed in the following.

6. Truncation: The most-significant bits (MSB) defined by the
requested number of bits (commonly equal to the security strength
of the DRBG) or the entropy available transported with the buffer
(which is the minimum of the message digest size and the available
entropy in all entropy pools and the auxiliary pool), whatever is
smaller, are obtained from the slow noise source output buffer.

7. Concatenation: The temporary seed buffer used to seed the DRNG
is a concatenation of the slow noise source buffer, the Jitter RNG
output, the CPU noise source output, and the current time.

The DRNG always tries to seed itself with 256 bits of entropy, except
during boot. In any case, if the noise sources cannot deliver that
amount, the available entropy is used and the DRNG keeps track on how
much entropy it was seeded with. The entropy implied by the LRNG
available in the entropy pool may be too conservative. To ensure
that during boot time all available entropy from the entropy pool is
transferred to the DRNG, the hash_df function always generates 256
data bits during boot to seed the DRNG. During boot, the DRNG is
seeded as follows:

1. The DRNG is reseeded from the entropy pool and potentially the fast
noise sources if the entropy pool has collected at least 32 bits of
entropy from the interrupt noise source. The goal of this step is to
ensure that the DRNG receives some initial entropy as early as
possible. In addition it receives the entropy available from
the fast noise sources.

2. The DRNG is reseeded from the entropy pool and potentially the fast
noise sources if all noise sources collectively can provide at least
128 bits of entropy.

3. The DRNG is reseeded from the entropy pool and potentially the fast
noise sources if all noise sources collectivel can provide at least 256
bits.

At the time of the reseeding steps, the DRNG requests as much entropy as
is available in order to skip certain steps and reach the seeding level
of 256 bits. This may imply that one or more of the aforementioned steps
are skipped.

In all listed steps, the DRNG is (re)seeded with a number of random
bytes from the entropy pool that is at most the amount of entropy
present in the entropy pool. This means that when the entropy pool
contains 128 or 256 bits of entropy, the DRNG is seeded with that
amount of entropy as well.

Before the DRNG is seeded with 256 bits of entropy in step 3,
requests of random data from /dev/random and the getrandom system
call are not processed.

The hash operation providing random data from the entropy pools will
always require that all entropy sources collectively can deliver at
least 128 entropy bits.

The DRNG operates as deterministic random number generator with the
following properties:

* The maximum number of random bytes that can be generated with one
DRNG generate operation is limited to 4096 bytes. When longer random
numbers are requested, multiple DRNG generate operations are performed.
The ChaCha20 DRNG as well as the SP800-90A DRBGs implement an update of
their state after completing a generate request for backtracking
resistance.

* The secondary DRNG is reseeded with whatever entropy is available –
in the worst case where no additional entropy can be provided by the
noise sources, the DRNG is not re-seeded and continues its operation
to try to reseed again after again the expiry of one of these thresholds:

 - If the last reseeding of the secondary DRNG is more than 600 seconds
   ago, or

 - 2^20 DRNG generate operations are performed, whatever comes first, or

 - the secondary DRNG is forced to reseed before the next generation of
   random numbers if data has been injected into the LRNG by writing data
   into /dev/random or /dev/urandom.

The chosen values prevent high-volume requests from user space to cause
frequent reseeding operations which drag down the performance of the
DRNG.

With the automatic reseeding after 600 seconds, the LRNG is triggered
to reseed itself before the first request after a suspend that put the
hardware to sleep for longer than 600 seconds.

To support smaller devices including IoT environments, this patch
allows reducing the runtime memory footprint of the LRNG at compile
time by selecting smaller collection data sizes.

When selecting the compilation of a kernel for a small environment,
prevent the allocation of a buffer up to 4096 bytes to serve user space
requests. In this case, the stack variable of 64 bytes is used to serve
all user space requests.

The LRNG has the following properties:

* internal noise source: interrupts timing with fast boot time seeding

* high performance of interrupt handling code: The LRNG impact on the
interrupt handling has been reduced to a minimum. On one example
system, the LRNG interrupt handling code in its fastest configuration
executes within an average 55 cycles whereas the existing
/dev/random on the same device takes about 97 cycles when measuring
the execution time of add_interrupt_randomness().

* use of almost never contended lock for hashing operation to collect
  raw entropy supporting concurrency-free use of massive parallel
  systems - worst case rate of contention is the number of DRNG
  reseeds, usually: number of NUMA nodes contentions per 5 minutes.

* use of standalone ChaCha20 based RNG with the option to use a
  different DRNG selectable at compile time

* instantiate one DRNG per NUMA node

* support for runtime switchable output DRNGs

* use of runtime-switchable hash for conditioning implementation
following widely accepted approach

* compile-time selectable collection size

* support of small systems by allowing the reduction of the
runtime memory needs

Further details including the rationale for the design choices and
properties of the LRNG together with testing is provided at [1].
In addition, the documentation explains the conducted regression
tests to verify that the LRNG is API and ABI compatible with the
existing /dev/random implementation.

Subject: [PATCH 02/14] LRNG - allocate one DRNG instance per NUMA node

In order to improve NUMA-locality when serving getrandom(2) requests,
allocate one DRNG instance per node.

The DRNG instance that is present right from the start of the kernel is
reused as the first per-NUMA-node DRNG. For all remaining online NUMA
nodes a new DRNG instance is allocated.

During boot time, the multiple DRNG instances are seeded sequentially.
With this, the first DRNG instance (referenced as the initial DRNG
in the code) is completely seeded with 256 bits of entropy before the
next DRNG instance is completely seeded.

When random numbers are requested, the NUMA-node-local DRNG is checked
whether it has been already fully seeded. If this is not the case, the
initial DRNG is used to serve the request.

Subject: [PATCH 03/14] LRNG - sysctls and /proc interface

The LRNG sysctl interface provides the same controls as the existing
/dev/random implementation. These sysctls behave identically and are
implemented identically. The goal is to allow a possible merge of the
existing /dev/random implementation with this implementation which
implies that this patch tries have a very close similarity. Yet, all
sysctls are documented at [1].

In addition, it provides the file lrng_type which provides details about
the LRNG:

- the name of the DRNG that produces the random numbers for /dev/random,
/dev/urandom, getrandom(2)

- the hash used to produce random numbers from the entropy pool

- the number of secondary DRNG instances

- indicator whether the LRNG operates SP800-90B compliant

- indicator whether a high-resolution timer is identified - only with a
high-resolution timer the interrupt noise source will deliver sufficient
entropy

- indicator whether the LRNG has been minimally seeded (i.e. is the
secondary DRNG seeded with at least 128 bits of entropy)

- indicator whether the LRNG has been fully seeded (i.e. is the
secondary DRNG seeded with at least 256 bits of entropy)

Subject: [PATCH 04/14] LRNG - add switchable DRNG support

The DRNG switch support allows replacing the DRNG mechanism of the
LRNG. The switching support rests on the interface definition of
include/linux/lrng.h. A new DRNG is implemented by filling in the
interface defined in this header file.

In addition to the DRNG, the extension also has to provide a hash
implementation that is used to hash the entropy pool for random number
extraction.

Note: It is permissible to implement a DRNG whose operations may sleep.
However, the hash function must not sleep.

The switchable DRNG support allows replacing the DRNG at runtime.
However, only one DRNG extension is allowed to be loaded at any given
time. Before replacing it with another DRNG implementation, the possibly
existing DRNG extension must be unloaded.

The switchable DRNG extension activates the new DRNG during load time.
It is expected, however, that such a DRNG switch would be done only once
by an administrator to load the intended DRNG implementation.

It is permissible to compile DRNG extensions either as kernel modules or
statically. The initialization of the DRNG extension should be performed
with a late_initcall to ensure the extension is available when user
space starts but after all other initialization completed.
The initialization is performed by registering the function call data
structure with the lrng_set_drng_cb function. In order to unload the
DRNG extension, lrng_set_drng_cb must be invoked with the NULL
parameter.

The DRNG extension should always provide a security strength that is at
least as strong as LRNG_DRNG_SECURITY_STRENGTH_BITS.

The hash extension must not sleep and must not maintain a separate
state.

Subject: [PATCH 05/14] LRNG - add common generic hash support

The LRNG switchable DRNG support also allows the replacement of the hash
implementation used as conditioning component. The common generic hash
support code provides the required callbacks using the synchronous hash
implementations of the kernel crypto API.

All synchronous hash implementations supported by the kernel crypto API
can be used as part of the LRNG with this generic support.

The generic support is intended to be configured by separate switchable
DRNG backends.

Subject: [PATCH 07/14] LRNG - add SP800-90A DRBG extension

Using the LRNG switchable DRNG support, the SP800-90A DRBG extension is
implemented.

The DRBG uses the kernel crypto API DRBG implementation. In addition, it
uses the kernel crypto API SHASH support to provide the hashing
operation.

The DRBG supports the choice of either a CTR DRBG using AES-256, HMAC
DRBG with SHA-512 core or Hash DRBG with SHA-512 core. The used core can
be selected with the module parameter lrng_drbg_type. The default is the
CTR DRBG.

When compiling the DRBG extension statically, the DRBG is loaded at
late_initcall stage which implies that with the start of user space, the
user space interfaces of getrandom(2), /dev/random and /dev/urandom
provide random data produced by an SP800-90A DRBG.

Subject: [PATCH 08/14] LRNG - add kernel crypto API PRNG extension

Add runtime-pluggable support for all PRNGs that are accessible via
the kernel crypto API, including hardware PRNGs. The PRNG is selected
with the module parameter drng_name where the name must be one that the
kernel crypto API can resolve into an RNG.

This allows using of the kernel crypto API PRNG implementations that
provide an interface to hardware PRNGs. Using this extension,
the LRNG uses the hardware PRNGs to generate random numbers. An
example is the S390 CPACF support providing such a PRNG.

The hash is provided by a kernel crypto API SHASH whose digest size
complies with the seedsize of the PRNG.

Subject: [PATCH 09/14] crypto: provide access to a static Jitter RNG state
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

To support the LRNG operation which uses the Jitter RNG separately
from the kernel crypto API, at a time where potentially the regular
memory management is not yet initialized, the Jitter RNG needs to
provide a state whose memory is defined at compile time. As only once
instance will ever be needed by the LRNG, define once static memory
block which is solely to be used by the LRNG.

Subject: [PATCH 11/14] LRNG - add SP800-90B compliant health tests
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Implement health tests for LRNG's slow noise sources as mandated by
SP-800-90B The file contains the following health tests:

- stuck test: The stuck test calculates the first, second and third
  discrete derivative of the time stamp to be processed by the hash
  for the per-CPU entropy pool. Only if all three values are non-zero,
  the received time delta is considered to be non-stuck.

- SP800-90B Repetition Count Test (RCT): The LRNG uses an enhanced
  version of the RCT specified in SP800-90B section 4.4.1. Instead of
  counting identical back-to-back values, the input to the RCT is the
  counting of the stuck values during the processing of received
  interrupt events. The RCT is applied with alpha=2^-30 compliant to
  the recommendation of FIPS 140-2 IG 9.8. During the counting operation,
  the LRNG always calculates the RCT cut-off value of C. If that value
  exceeds the allowed cut-off value, the LRNG will trigger the health
  test failure discussed below. An error is logged to the kernel log
  that such RCT failure occurred. This test is only applied and
  enforced in FIPS mode, i.e. when the kernel compiled with
  CONFIG_CONFIG_FIPS is started with fips=1.

- SP800-90B Adaptive Proportion Test (APT): The LRNG implements the
  APT as defined in SP800-90B section 4.4.2. The applied significance
  level again is alpha=2^-30 compliant to the recommendation of FIPS
  140-2 IG 9.8.

The aforementioned health tests are applied to the first 1,024 time stamps
obtained from interrupt events. In case one error is identified for either
the RCT, or the APT, the collected entropy is invalidated and the
SP800-90B startup health test is restarted.

As long as the SP800-90B startup health test is not completed, all LRNG
random number output interfaces that may block will block and not generate
any data. This implies that only those potentially blocking interfaces are
defined to provide random numbers that are seeded with the interrupt noise
source being SP800-90B compliant. All other output interfaces will not be
affected by the SP800-90B startup test and thus are not considered
SP800-90B compliant.

At runtime, the SP800-90B APT and RCT are applied to each time stamp
generated for a received interrupt. When either the APT and RCT indicates
a noise source failure, the LRNG is reset to a state it has immediately
after boot:

- all entropy counters are set to zero

- the SP800-90B startup tests are re-performed which implies that
getrandom(2) would block again until new entropy was collected

To summarize, the following rules apply:

• SP800-90B compliant output interfaces

  - /dev/random

  - getrandom(2) system call

  -  get_random_bytes kernel-internal interface when being triggered by
     the callback registered with add_random_ready_callback

• SP800-90B non-compliant output interfaces

  - /dev/urandom

  - get_random_bytes kernel-internal interface called directly

  - randomize_page kernel-internal interface

  - get_random_u32 and get_random_u64 kernel-internal interfaces

  - get_random_u32_wait, get_random_u64_wait, get_random_int_wait, and
    get_random_long_wait kernel-internal interfaces

If either the RCT, or the APT health test fails irrespective whether
during initialization or runtime, the following actions occur:

  1. The entropy of the entire entropy pool is invalidated.

  2. All DRNGs are reset which imply that they are treated as being
     not seeded and require a reseed during next invocation.

  3. The SP800-90B startup health test are initiated with all
     implications of the startup tests. That implies that from that point
     on, new events must be observed and its entropy must be inserted into
     the entropy pool before random numbers are calculated from the
     entropy pool.

Further details on the SP800-90B compliance and the availability of all
test tools required to perform all tests mandated by SP800-90B are
provided at [1].

The entire health testing code is compile-time configurable.

The patch provides a CONFIG_BROKEN configuration of the APT / RCT cutoff
values which have a high likelihood to trigger the health test failure.
The BROKEN APT cutoff is set to the exact mean of the expected value if
the time stamps are equally distributed (512 time stamps divided by 16
possible values due to using the 4 LSB of the time stamp). The BROKEN
RCT cutoff value is set to 1 which is likely to be triggered during
regular operation.

Subject: [PATCH 12/14] LRNG - add interface for gathering of raw entropy

The test interface allows a privileged process to capture the raw
unconditioned noise that is collected by the LRNG for statistical
analysis. Such testing allows the analysis how much entropy
the interrupt noise source provides on a given platform.
Extracted noise data is not used to seed the LRNG. This
is a test interface and not appropriate for production systems.
Yet, the interface is considered to be sufficiently secured for
production systems.

Access to the data is given through the lrng_raw debugfs file. The
data buffer should be multiples of sizeof(u32) to fill the entire
buffer. Using the option lrng_testing.boot_test=1 the raw noise of
the first 1000 entropy events since boot can be sampled.

This test interface allows generating the data required for
analysis whether the LRNG is in compliance with SP800-90B
sections 3.1.3 and 3.1.4.

In addition, the test interface allows gathering of the concatenated raw
entropy data to verify that the concatenation works appropriately.
This includes sampling of the following raw data:

* high-resolution time stamp

* Jiffies

* IRQ number

* IRQ flags

* return instruction pointer

* interrupt register state

* array logic batching the high-resolution time stamp

* enabling the runtime configuration of entropy source entropy rates

Also, a testing interface to support ACVT of the hash implementation
is provided. The reason why only hash testing is supported (as
opposed to also provide testing for the DRNG) is the fact that the
LRNG software hash implementation contains glue code that may
warrant testing in addition to the testing of the software ciphers
via the kernel crypto API. Also, for testing the CTR-DRBG, the
underlying AES implementation would need to be tested. However,
such AES test interface cannot be provided by the LRNG as it has no
means to access the AES operation.

Finally, the execution duration for processing a time stamp can be
obtained with the LRNG raw entropy interface.

If a test interface is not compiled, its code is a noop which has no
impact on the performance.

Subject: [PATCH 13/14] LRNG - add power-on and runtime self-tests

Parts of the LRNG are already covered by self-tests, including:

* Self-test of SP800-90A DRBG provided by the Linux kernel crypto API.

* Self-test of the PRNG provided by the Linux kernel crypto API.

* Raw noise source data testing including SP800-90B compliant
  tests when enabling CONFIG_LRNG_HEALTH_TESTS

This patch adds the self-tests for the remaining critical functions of
the LRNG that are essential to maintain entropy and provide
cryptographic strong random numbers. The following self-tests are
implemented:

* Self-test of the time array maintenance. This test verifies whether
the time stamp array management to store multiple values in one integer
implements a concatenation of the data.

* Self-test of the software hash implementation ensures that this
function operates compliant to the FIPS 180-4 specification. The
self-test performs a hash operation of a zeroized per-CPU data array.

* Self-test of the ChaCha20 DRNG is based on the self-tests that are
already present and implemented with the stand-alone user space
ChaCha20 DRNG implementation available at [1]. The self-tests cover
different use cases of the DRNG seeded with known seed data.

The status of the LRNG self-tests is provided with the selftest_status
SysFS file. If the file contains a zero, the self-tests passed. The
value 0xffffffff means that the self-tests were not executed. Any other
value indicates a self-test failure.

The self-test may be compiled to panic the system if the self-test
fails.

All self-tests operate on private state data structures. This implies
that none of the self-tests have any impact on the regular LRNG
operations. This allows the self-tests to be repeated at runtime by
writing anything into the selftest_status SysFS file.
