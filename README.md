# General Information about kernels
## Scheduler Support

We have provided all these CPU schedulers because each scheduler performs
differently depending on usage. We recommend testing each one to determine
which best suits your specific requirements.

- **([BORE](https://github.com/firelzrd))** **Burst-Oriented Response
Enhancer** Scheduler by [firelzrd](https://github.com/firelzrd/bore-scheduler)
`linux-cachyos` / `linux-cachyos-bore`

- **([EEVDF](https://lwn.net/Articles/927530/))** **Earliest Eligible Virtual
Deadline** - `linux-cachyos-eevdf`

- **([BMQ](https://gitlab.com/alfredchen/linux-prjc))** **BitMap queue CPU
Scheduler** Scheduler by [Alfred Chen](https://gitlab.com/alfredchen) -
`linux-cachyos-bmq`


> [!NOTE]
> The CachyOS repositories provide prebuilt kernels in three different
> march versions: `x86-64`, `x86-64-v3`,`x86-64-v4` and `znver4`. The default
> `linux-cachyos` kernel is compiled with Clang, Thin LTO and uses our AutoFDO + Propeller profile.
> For this kernel there is a `linux-cachyos-gcc` variant available.

## Features
### :hammer_and_wrench: Advanced building & compiling

### [Explaination of the kernel variants](https://wiki.cachyos.org/features/kernel)

# [CachyOS repositories](https://mirror.cachyos.org/)

The repositories contain both Arch Linux and CachyOS packages, which have been
re-built with flags optimized for performance, stability, and security.

- `znver4` - Dedicated Zen4 optimized repository used for Zen 4 and Zen 5 CPUs
- `x86-64-v4` - all Arch Linux packages with enhanced compilation flags
- `x86-64-v3` - all Arch Linux packages with enhanced compilation flags
- `x86-64` - currently only kernel packages

## How to add CachyOS repositories

### Option 1: Automated Installation of CachyOS repositories

We've made it easy for you! Simply run the following commands to use our helper
script that does all the work for you.  ðŸ˜‰

Run the following commands:

1. Get archive with script

```
curl -O https://mirror.cachyos.org/cachyos-repo.tar.xz
```

2. Extract and enter into the archive
```
tar xvf cachyos-repo.tar.xz && cd cachyos-repo
```

3. Run script with sudo
```
sudo ./cachyos-repo.sh
```

#### Behaviour of script

1. Script will auto-detect CPU architecture, if CPU has `x86-64-v4` or `x86-64-v3`
support, script will automatically use the repositories, which are optimized
with this flag and some other flags.

2. Script will backup your old `pacman.conf`.

For more information, check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/cachyos) or
join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cachyos-862292009423470592) community.

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Add CachyOS signing keys

```
sudo pacman-key --recv-keys F3B607488DB35A47 --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key F3B607488DB35A47
```

2. Install required packages

> [!CAUTION]
> Installing the CachyOS Pacman, will install a forked pacman with
> features added from CachyOS, like "INSTALLED_FROM" and an automatic
> architecture check.
>
> Pacman 6.1 added a feature validation feature, which could lead when using the
> Arch Linux pacman into warnings. We are working with Arch Linux to provide a
> proper compatibility again.
>
> If you want to avoid this, don't add the "cachyos" repository, which contains
> the customized pacman. All other repositories like cachyos-v3, cachyos-v4,
> cachyos-extra/core-v3/4 are fine to add.

```
sudo pacman -U 'https://mirror.cachyos.org/repo/x86_64/cachyos/cachyos-keyring-20240331-1-any.pkg.tar.zst' \
    'https://mirror.cachyos.org/repo/x86_64/cachyos/cachyos-mirrorlist-22-1-any.pkg.tar.zst' \
    'https://mirror.cachyos.org/repo/x86_64/cachyos/cachyos-v3-mirrorlist-22-1-any.pkg.tar.zst' \
    'https://mirror.cachyos.org/repo/x86_64/cachyos/cachyos-v4-mirrorlist-22-1-any.pkg.tar.zst' \
    'https://mirror.cachyos.org/repo/x86_64/cachyos/pacman-7.0.0.r7.g1f38429-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst'
```

If you want to go back to the Arch Linux repositories and had our version of
pacman installed, you will need to run the following command after the rollback
to avoid getting ``%INSTALLED_DB%`` warnings:

```
sudo find /var/lib/pacman/local/ -type f -name "desc" -exec sed -i '/^%INSTALLED_DB%$/,+2d' {} \;
```

## Check CPU compatibility

If you want to add our repositories manually, you must check the compatibility
of the CPU with cachyos repositories.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the script above to add CachyOS repositories, you can skip
> the check.

#### 1. Check support by running the following the command

```
/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep supported
```

#### 2. Understanding of command output

Pay attention to the following text with brackets. **(supported, searched)**

- If you see `x86-64-v4 (supported, searched)`, that means the **CPU is
compatible** and can use **x86-64-v4** instruction set.

- If you see `x86-64-v4`, that means the **CPU is incompatible** and can't use
**x86-64-v4** instruction set.

#### Example of CPU compatible with x86-64-v4 instruction set
```
> /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep supported
  x86-64-v4 (supported, searched)
  x86-64-v3 (supported, searched)
  x86-64-v2 (supported, searched)
```

### 3. Adding cachyos repositories
You need to edit `pacman.conf` and add repositories.
```
sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf
```

#### if your CPU supports `x86-64`, then add only `[cachyos]` repositories
```
# cachyos repos
[cachyos]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-mirrorlist
```

#### if your CPU supports `x86-64-v3`, then add `[cachyos-v3]`,`[cachyos-core-v3]`,`[cachyos-extra-v3]` and `[cachyos]`
```
# cachyos repos
## Only add if your CPU does v3 architecture
[cachyos-v3]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-v3-mirrorlist
[cachyos-core-v3]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-v3-mirrorlist
[cachyos-extra-v3]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-v3-mirrorlist
[cachyos]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-mirrorlist
```

#### if your CPU supports `x86-64-v4`, then add `[cachyos-v4]`, `[cachyos-core-v4]`, `[cachyos-extra-v4]` and `[cachyos]`
```
# cachyos repos
## Only add if your CPU does support x86-64-v4 architecture
[cachyos-v4]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-v4-mirrorlist
[cachyos-core-v4]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-v4-mirrorlist
[cachyos-extra-v4]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-v4-mirrorlist
[cachyos]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-mirrorlist
```

Finally, update your system with CachyOS packages:

```
sudo pacman -Syu
```
Enjoy improved system speed with CachyOS packages!

## Debug packages

This is handled via debuginfod. Just add following file to
`/etc/debuginfod/cachyos.urls`

```
https://debuginfod.cachyos.org
```

## Uninstalling CachyOS repositories

See [Uninstalling Cachyos Repositories](https://wiki.cachyos.org/features/optimized_repos/#uninstalling-cachyos-repositories)

## SCX Schedulers
