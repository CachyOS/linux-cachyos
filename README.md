# General Information about kernels
The Schedulers listed below are supported

## linux-cachyos
We have provided all these CPU schedulers because each scheduler performs differently depending on usage. We recommend testing each one to determine which best suits your specific requirements.
- **([EEVDF](https://lwn.net/Articles/927530/))** **Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline** & **([BORE](https://github.com/firelzrd/bore-scheduler))** **Burst-Oriented Response Enhancer** - have been combined in the `linux-cachyos`.
- **([BORE](https://github.com/firelzrd/bore-scheduler))** **Burst-Oriented Response Enhancer** Scheduler by [firelzrd (BORE)](https://github.com/firelzrd/bore-scheduler) `linux-bore` / `linux-cachyos-bore`
- **([EEVDF](https://lwn.net/Articles/927530/))** **Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline** - `linux-cachyos-eevdf`
- **(TT) - Task Type** Scheduler by [Hamad Marri](https://github.com/hamadmarri/TT-CPU-Scheduler) - `linux-cachyos-tt` / `linux-tt`
- **(BMQ) - BitMap Queue** by Alfred Chen - `linux-cachyos-bmq`
- **(PDS) - Priority and Deadline based Skiplist multiple queue** by Alfred Chen - `linux-cachyos-pds`
- **(CFS) - Standard Scheduler Completely Fair Scheduler** - `linux-cachyos-cfs`
#### CachyOS default kernel
> - **([EEVDF](https://lwn.net/Articles/927530/))** **Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline** & **([BORE](https://github.com/firelzrd/bore-scheduler))** **Burst-Oriented Response Enhancer** - have been combined in the `linux-cachyos`.

### :books: Archived schedulers
- **CacULE and CacULE-RDB** by Hamad Marri, supported by CachyOS in the past as - `linux-cachyos-cacule`  
  ***ATTENTION:** Not supported after version 6.1. If you still want to use it, you can get it from the archive repository - [linux-cacule](https://github.com/ptr1337/linux-cacule)*
> The CachyOS repositories provide prebuilt kernels in three different march versions: `x86-64`, `x86-64-v3`, and `x86-64-v4`. In addition, the repositories also offer LTO-enabled kernels.

## Features
Here is a list of features of Linux kernels prebuilt in the CachyOS repositories for `x86-64-v4`, `x86-64-v3`, and `x86-64`.
### :hammer_and_wrench: Advanced building & compiling
- Very customizable PKGBUILD with many features and improvements.
- `GCC/CLANG` Optimization with automatically found CPU architecture or also selectable CPU architecture.
- Choose between `LLVM/LTO & Thin-LTO` or `GCC`.
- Choose between 300Hz, 500Hz, 600 Hz ,750Hz and 1000Hz. Defaults to 500Hz for BORE/CFS/EEVDF and 1000Hz for other schedulers.
- Kernel Control Flow Integrity (kCFI) selectable when using `LLVM`

### :abacus: CPU enhancements
- 6 Different scheduler are supported,`CFS`,`TT`,`BMQ`,`BORE`,`PDS` and `EEVDF` scheduler.
- Latency Nice included with EEVDF
- AMD P-State Preferred Core and enabled as default

# [CachyOS repositories](https://mirror.cachyos.org/)
The repositories contain both Arch Linux and CachyOS packages, which have been re-built with flags optimized for performance, stability, and security.
- `x86-64-v4` - currently only kernel packages + LTO.
- `x86-64-v3` - all Arch Linux packages + LTO.
- `x86-64` - all Arch Linux packages + LTO.

## How to add CachyOS repositories
### ðŸ¦¾ Automatic adding of cachyos repositories
Run following commands:
1. Get archive with script
```
wget https://mirror.cachyos.org/cachyos-repo.tar.xz
```
> If don't have `wget`, install them by `sudo pacman -S wget`

2. Extract and enter into the archive
```
tar xvf cachyos-repo.tar.xz && cd cachyos-repo
```

3. Run script with sudo
```
sudo ./cachyos-repo.sh
```

#### Behaviour of script  
1. The script automatically detects the CPU architecture. If the CPU supports `x86-64-v4` or `x86-64-v3`, the script uses the repositories optimized with this flag and other flags.
2. The script will create a backup of your previous `pacman.conf` file.

### Manually
1. Add both keys
```
sudo pacman-key --recv-keys F3B607488DB35A47 --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com
```
```
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key F3B607488DB35A47
```

2. You can download first initial packages
```
sudo pacman -U 'https://mirror.cachyos.org/repo/x86_64/cachyos/cachyos-keyring-3-1-any.pkg.tar.zst' 'https://mirror.cachyos.org/repo/x86_64/cachyos/cachyos-mirrorlist-18-1-any.pkg.tar.zst' 'https://mirror.cachyos.org/repo/x86_64/cachyos/cachyos-v3-mirrorlist-18-1-any.pkg.tar.zst' 'https://mirror.cachyos.org/repo/x86_64/cachyos/cachyos-v4-mirrorlist-6-1-any.pkg.tar.zst' 'https://mirror.cachyos.org/repo/x86_64/cachyos/pacman-6.0.2-14-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst'
```

## Check CPU compatibility
If you want to add our repositories manually, you must check the compatibility of the CPU with cachyos repositories.
> If you use script above for adding cachyos repositories, you can skip checking.

### 1. Check support by the following the command
```
/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep supported
```

### 2. Understanding of command output
Pay attention to the following text with brackets. **(supported, searched)**
- If you see `x86-64-v4 (supported, searched)`, that means the **CPU is compatible** and can use **x86-64-v4** instruction set.
- If you see `x86-64-v4`, that means the **CPU is incompatible** and can't use **x86-64-v4** instruction set.

#### Example of CPU compatible with x86-64-v4 instruction set
```
> /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep supported
  x86-64-v4 (supported, searched)
  x86-64-v3 (supported, searched)
  x86-64-v2 (supported, searched)
  haswell (AT_PLATFORM; supported, searched)
  tls (supported, searched)
  avx512_1 (supported, searched)
  x86_64 (supported, searched)
```

#### Example of CPU incompatible with x86-64-v4 instruction set
```
  > /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep supported
     STDIN
  40 Subdirectories of glibc-hwcaps directories, in priority order:
  41   x86-64-v4
  42   x86-64-v3 (supported, searched)                                          
  43   x86-64-v2 (supported, searched)       
```

### 3. Adding cachyos repositories
You need edit `pacman.conf` and add repositories.
```
sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf
```

#### if CPU support `x86-64`, then add only `[cachyos]` repositories
```
# cachyos repos
## Only add if your CPU does v3 architecture
[cachyos]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-mirrorlist
```

#### if CPU support `x86-64-v3`, then add `[cachyos-v3]`,`[cachyos-core-v3]`, `[cachyos-extra-v3]` and `[cachyos]`
```
# cachyos repos
## Only add if your CPU does v3 architecture
[cachyos-v3]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-v3-mirrorlist
[cachyos-core-v3]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-v3-mirrorlist
[cachyos-extra-v3]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-v3-mirrorlist
[cachyos]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-mirrorlist
```

#### if CPU support `x86-64-v4`, then add `[cachyos-v4]`, `[cachyos-v3]`, `[cachyos-core-v3]`, `[cachyos-extra-v3]` and `[cachyos]`
```
# cachyos repos
## Only add if your CPU does support x86-64-v4 architecture
[cachyos-v4]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-v4-mirrorlist
[cachyos-v3]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-v3-mirrorlist
[cachyos-core-v3]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-v3-mirrorlist
[cachyos-extra-v3]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-v3-mirrorlist
[cachyos]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/cachyos-mirrorlist
```

## Other GNU/Linux distributions
- Complete patch for simple patching on the kernel
- It is planned to implement into our kernel builder from cachyos buildsystem, which works also on other distributions.

### Gentoo
Its a community maintained ebuild from a user, which can be used for a dynamic building right [here](https://github.com/Szowisz/CachyOS-kernels)

Or simply run:
```
eselect repository add CachyOS-kernels git https://github.com/Szowisz/CachyOS-kernels
emaint sync -r CachyOS-kernels
```
### Fedora
[Port](https://github.com/sirlucjan/copr-linux-cachyos) of kernel linux-cachyos-bore and linux-cachyos-bore-lto by [bieszczaders](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/bieszczaders/kernel-cachyos/)

Only x86_64_v3 versions are available. Check support by the following the command
```
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep "(supported, searched)"

```
If it does not detect x86_64_v3 support do not install the kernel. Otherwise you will end up with a non-functioning operating system!
